# Ability Name		Category of Ability	Type		Required Ability								Required Stat	PRETOTALAB		Description																					Modify VAR							Benefits
Furious Focus		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat														PRETOTALAB:1	DESC:Even in the midst of fierce and furious blows, you can find focus in the carnage and your seemingly wild blows strike home.									BENEFIT:When you are wielding a two-handed weapon or a one-handed weapon with two hands, and making a power attack, you do not suffer the power attack penalty on the first attack you make each turn. You still suffer the penalty on any additional attacks, including attacks of opportunity.

BONUS:VAR|CMB_DirtyTricks|4|TYPE=Competence	BENEFIT:You receive a +2 bonus on checks made to attempt a dirty trick. This bonus stacks with the bonus granted by Improved Deft Maneuvers. Whenever you successfully perform a dirty trick, the penalty lasts for 1d4 rounds, plus 1 round for every 5 by which your attack exceeds the target's CMD. In addition, removing the condition requires the target to spend a standard action.

BONUS:VAR|CMB_Reposition|4|TYPE=Competence	BENEFIT:You receive a +2 bonus on checks made to reposition a foe. This bonus stacks with the bonus granted by Improved Deft Maneuvers. Whenever you reposition a foe, his movement provokes attacks of opportunity from all of your allies (but not you).
Greater Steal		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Improved Deft Maneuvers		PRESTAT:1,DEX=13	PRETOTALAB:6	DESC:You have a knack for snatching items from your opponent in combat.											BONUS:VAR|CMB_Steal|4|TYPE=Competence		BENEFIT:You receive a +2 bonus on checks made to steal an item from a foe. This bonus stacks with the bonus granted by Improved Deft Maneuvers. If you successfully steal an item from a foe during combat, it does not notice the theft until after combat is over or if it attempts to use the missing item.
Pushing Assault		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat			                                                PRESTAT:1,STR=15	PRETOTALAB:1	DESC:A strike made with a two-handed weapon can push a similar sized opponent backward.	BENEFIT:When you hit a creature your size or smaller with a two-handed weapon power attack, you can choose to push the target 5 feet directly away from you instead of dealing the extra power attack damage. If you score a critical hit, you can instead push the target 10 feet directly away from you. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunities, and the target must end this move in a safe space it can stand in. You choose which effect to apply after the attack roll has been made, but before the damage is rolled.
