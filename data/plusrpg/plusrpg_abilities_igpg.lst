The concept of life on other planets far beyond Golarion has always fascinated you, and you've long hoped to learn more about what life on those other planets may have been like. You've heard stories about the strange alien creatures found in Numerian dungeons and hope to learn all you can about them-perhaps some of these aliens can be found in the caverns below Torch! You gain a +2 trait bonus on Ecology checks to identify alien monsters' abilities and weaknesses. In addition, you gain a +1 trait bonus on Knowledge (geography) checks, and this skill is a class skill for you. You are treated as if you possessed the Technologist feat for the purposes of resolving Ecology checks to identify an alien creature and for all Knowledge (geography) checks. If you already possess the Technologist feat, then your trait bonus on Knowledge (geography) checks increases to +3.
