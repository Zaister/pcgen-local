Bloodrage		KEY:Bloodrager ~ Bloodrage	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bloodrager Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural.AttackOption.Rage.Bloodrage	SERVESAS:ABILITY=Special Ability|Barbarian ~ Rage	DESC:You can call upon inner reserves of strength and ferocity, granting you additional combat prowess. You can bloodrage for %1 rounds per day. You can enter a bloodrage as a free action. The total number of rounds of bloodrage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours need not be consecutive. While in a bloodrage, you gain a +%2 bonus on melee attack rolls, melee damage rolls, thrown weapon damage rolls, and Will saving throws. In addition, you take a -%3 penalty to Armor Class. You also gain %4 temporary hit points. These temporary hit points are lost first when you take damage, disappear when the rage ends, and are not replenished if you enter a bloodrage again within 1 minute of your previous bloodrage or rage. While in a bloodrage, you cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skill (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration (such as spellcasting). You end your bloodrage as a free action, and are fatigued for 1 minute after a bloodrage ends. You can't enter a new bloodrage while fatigued or exhausted, but can otherwise enter a bloodrage multiple times per day. If you fall unconscious, your bloodrage immediately ends. Bloodrage counts as the barbarian's rage class feature for the purpose of feat prerequisites, feat abilities, magic item abilities, and spell effects.|RageDuration|RageBonus|RageACPenalty|RageBonusHP	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Unchained Rage	BONUS:VAR|RageLVL|BloodragerLVL	BONUS:VAR|RageDuration|HumanBloodragerFavClassBonus
