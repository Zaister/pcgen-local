CATEGORY=Special Ability|Slayer ~ Studied Target.MOD	DESC:.CLEAR		DESC:A slayer can study an opponent to gain a +%1 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, and Sense Motive; a +%2 bonus on Perception, and Survival checks attempted against that opponent; and a +%1 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against it. The DCs of slayer class abilities against that opponent increase by %1. A slayer can only maintain these bonuses against %1 opponents at a time; these bonuses remain in effect until either the opponent is dead or the slayer studies a new target. If a slayer deals sneak attack damage to a target, he can study that target as a reaction, allowing him to apply his studied target bonuses against that target (including to the normal weapon damage roll). The slayer may discard this connection to a studied target as a free action, allowing him to study another target in its place. A slayer can study an opponent he can see as a simple action.|SlayerStudiedTargetBonus|SlayerStudiedTargetFavClassBonus
