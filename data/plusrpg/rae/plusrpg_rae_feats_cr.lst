CATEGORY=FEAT|Channel Smite.MOD			BENEFIT:.CLEAR	BENEFIT:Before you make a melee attack roll, you can choose to spend one use of your channel energy ability as a simple action. If you channel positive energy and you hit an undead creature, that creature takes an amount of additional damage equal to the damage dealt by your channel positive energy ability. If you channel negative energy and you hit a living creature, that creature takes an amount of additional damage equal to the damage dealt by your channel negative energy ability. Your target can make a Will save, as normal, to halve this additional damage. If your attack misses, the channel energy ability is still expended with no effect.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Cleave.MOD				BENEFIT:.CLEAR	BENEFIT:You can use the following advanced action--Cleave (Attack, 2 Acts): You make a single attack at your full base attack bonus against a foe within reach. If you hit, you deal damage normally and can make an additional attack (using your full base attack bonus) against a foe that is adjacent to the first and also within reach. You can only make one additional attack per round with this feat. When you use this feat, you take a -2 penalty to your Armor Class until your next turn.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Combat Reflexes.MOD			BENEFIT:.CLEAR	BENEFIT:You may take a number of additional recations between your turns equal to your Dexterity bonus, but those reations can only be used to take attacks of opportunity. With this feat, you may also make attacks of opportunity while flat-footed.

CATEGORY=FEAT|Diehard.MOD				BENEFIT:.CLEAR	BENEFIT:Whenever your hit point total is reduced below 0, but you are not dead, you may choose to make an Endurance check with a DC of 10 + your negative hit point total to stay conscious and act as if you were disabled, rather than dying. You must make this decision as soon as you are reduced to negative hit points (even if it isn't your turn). If you do not choose to make an Endurance check, of if you fail the check, you immediately fall unconscious, but you automatically stabilize. You do not need to make an Endurance check each round to avoid losing additional hit points. You can move without further injuring yourself, but if you perform an advanced action, an action with the attack subtype, or any other action deemed as strenuous, including some simple actions, such as casting a quickened spell, you must make an Endurance check with a DC of 10 + your negative hit point total or take 1 point of damage after completing the act. You take a cumulative -2 penalty on all Endurance checks per such act as long as your hit points are below 0. If your negative hit points are equal to or greater than your Constitution score, you immediately die.

This feat has no effect on targets that are staggered.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Great Cleave.MOD			BENEFIT:.CLEAR	BENEFIT:When you take the cleave action, you can make a single attack at your full base attack bonus against a foe within reach. If you hit, you deal damage normally and can make an additional attack (using your full base attack bonus) against a foe that is adjacent to the previous foe and also within reach. If you hit, you can continue to make attacks against foes adjacent to the previous foe, so long as they are within your reach. You cannot attack an individual foe more than once during this attack action. When you use this feat, you take a -2 penalty to your Armor Class until your next turn.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Greater Grapple.MOD			BENEFIT:.CLEAR	BENEFIT:Your competence bonus on attack rolls made to grapple a foe from your Improved Grapple feat increases to +4. Once you have grappled a creature, maintaining the grapple is a simple action.

CATEGORY=FEAT|Manyshot.MOD				BENEFIT:.CLEAR	BENEFIT:You can use the following advanced action--Manyshot (Attack, 2 Acts): You fire two arrows from a bow with a single attack. You take a –⁠2 penalty to this attack roll. If the attack hits, both arrows hit. Apply precision-based damage (such as sneak attack) and critical hit damage only once for this attack. Damage bonuses from using a composite bow with a high Strength bonus apply to each arrow, as do other damage bonuses, such as a ranger's favored enemy bonus. When your base attack reaches +11, and again when it reaches +16, you may add an additional arrow to this attack. However, each arrow adds a cumulative –2 penalty to the attack roll.

CATEGORY=FEAT|Rapid Reload.MOD			BENEFIT:.CLEAR	BENEFIT:The time required for you to reload your chosen type of weapon is reduced.
