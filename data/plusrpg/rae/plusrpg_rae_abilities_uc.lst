###Block: Gunslinger abilities
# Ability Name									Clear Description	Description																																																																																																																																										Source, Long Desc.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Gunslinger ~ Gunslinger's Dodge.MOD	DESC:.CLEAR		DESC:At 1st level, the gunslinger gains an uncanny knack for getting out of the way of ranged attacks. When a ranged attack is made against the gunslinger, she can spend 1 grit point to move 5 feet as a reaction; doing so grants the gunslinger a +2 bonus to AC against the triggering attack. This movement is not a 5-foot step, and provokes attacks of opportunity. Alternatively, the gunslinger can drop prone to gain a +4 bonus to AC against the triggering attack. The gunslinger can only perform this deed while wearing medium or light armor, and while carrying no more than a light load.																																									SOURCELONG:Ultimate Combat
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Gunslinger ~ Quick Clear.MOD			DESC:.CLEAR		DESC:At 1st level, as an advanced action (2 acts), the gunslinger can remove the broken condition from a single firearm she is currently wielding, as long as that condition was gained by a firearm misfire. The gunslinger must have at least 1 grit point to perform this deed. Alternatively, if the gunslinger spends 1 grit point to perform this deed, she can perform quick clear as a simple action instead of an advanced action.																																																																				SOURCELONG:Ultimate Combat
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Gunslinger ~ Pistol-Whip.MOD			DESC:.CLEAR		DESC:At 3rd level, the gunslinger can make a surprise melee attack with the butt or handle of her firearm as a simple attack action. When she does, she is considered to be proficient with the firearm as a melee weapon and gains a bonus on the attack and damage rolls equal to the enhancement bonus of the firearm. The damage dealt by the pistol-whip is of the bludgeoning type, and is determined by the size of the firearm. One-handed firearms deal 1d6 points of damage (1d4 if wielded by Small creatures) and twohanded firearms deal 1d10 points of damage (1d8 if wielded by Small creatures). Regardless of the gunslinger's size, the critical multiplier of this attack is 20/x2. If the attack hits, the gunslinger can make a combat maneuver check to knock the target prone as a free action. Performing this deed costs 1 grit point.	SOURCELONG:Ultimate Combat
