As a swift action, you choose one target within sight to smite. If this target is evil, you add +%2 to your attack rolls and +%3 to all weapon damage rolls made against the target of your smite. If the target of Smite Evil has an evil aura, the bonus to damage on the first successful attack increases to +%4. (Evil dragons, evil undead, outsiders with the evil subtype, clerics of evil deities, or creatures under the effect of an evil magical effect have evil auras.)
