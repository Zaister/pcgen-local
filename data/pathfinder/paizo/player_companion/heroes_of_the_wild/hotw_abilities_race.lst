The character selects three 0-level druid spells and one 1st-level druid spell. If the character has a Charisma score of 11 or higher, when in the selected terrain, she gains these spells as spell-like abilities that can be cast once per day.

These spells are treated as being from a fey source for the purposes of the druid's resist nature's lure class feature and similar abilities.
