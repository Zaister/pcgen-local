Spiny Carapace	KEY:Spiny Carapace ~ Spiny Eurypterid	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Defensive								DESC:The spiny eurypterid's carapace is covered with thousands of razor-sharp spines. Any creature that attacks a spiny eurypterid with a light weapon, unarmed strike, or natural attack takes 1d6 points of piercing damage. Any creature that grapples or is grappled by a spiny eurypterid automatically takes 2d6 points of piercing damage per round the grapple is maintained.

Spit			KEY:Spit ~ Spitting Eurypterid		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary			DEFINE:EurypteridSpitDC|0			DESC:A spitting eurypterid can expel a high-pressure jet of water from a vent just below its mouth with startling accuracy and force. This spit attack is equally effective above or below water, creating a 40-foot line that inflicts 10d6 points of nonlethal damage to all creatures in the area of effect. In addition, creatures that take damage from this jet of water are stunned for 1 round. A DC %1 Fortitude save halves the damage and negates the stun effect. Once a spitting eurypterid uses this ability, it cannot use it again until it takes a full-round action while completely submerged to draw more water into its body.|EurypteridSpitDC	BONUS:VAR|EurypteridSpitDC|10+(HD/2)+CON					SOURCEPAGE:p.79
