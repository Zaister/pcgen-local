Curse of the Grave	KEY:Curse of the Grave ~ Darnoc	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural						DESC:Any damage dealt by a darnoc's slam attack does not heal naturally and resists all magical healing (potions, cure spells, and so on).

Discord			KEY:Discord ~ Darnoc			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.SpellLike		DEFINE:DarnocDiscordDC|0	DESC:Once per day as a standard action, a darnoc can scribe a symbol in the air. All creatures with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher within 60 feet who see the symbol must succeed on a DC %1 Will save or immediately fall into loud bickering and arguing. Meaningful communication is impossible. If the affected creatures have different alignments, there is a 50%% chance that they attack each other. Bickering lasts 5d4 rounds. Fighting begins 1d4 rounds into the bickering and lasts 2d4 rounds. Once triggered, the symbol lasts 2 hours.

# Ability Name			Unique Key							Category of Ability		Type								Define						Description																																																																																																																																																																	Modify VAR								Source Page
Create Spawn			KEY:Create Spawn ~ Black Jinni			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural										DESC:A humanoid or genie slain by a black jinni’s searing touch rises 1d4 rounds later as an undead spawn. Humanoids rise as zombies; jann rise as ghuls; and djinn, efreet, shaitans, and marids rise as great ghuls. Spawn created by a black jinni are under its control.																																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.82
Dust Vortex				KEY:Dust Vortex ~ Black Jinni				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural			DEFINE:BlackJinniDustVortexDC|0		DESC:Once per day, as a full-round action, a black jinni can cause the obscuring cloud that surrounds it to become a vortex of electrically-charged dust. This vortex is 20 feet high and radiates to a range of 30 feet, with the black jinni at the vortex’s center. The winds within this area are considered a windstorm, making normal ranged attacks impossible and causing a -4 penalty to siege weapon attacks against creatures in the vortex. Creatures within the vortex are subjected to wind effects - those who are blown back are instead drawn toward the center to a square adjacent to the black jinni. A creature that ends its turn within the dust vortex takes 10d6 points of electricity damage (DC %1 Reflex save halves). Once the dust vortex is created, it remains stationary, allowing the black jinni to move around in it or even leave it. The vortex remains in place for 1d6 rounds, or until the black jinni dismisses it as a move action.|BlackJinniDustVortexDC	BONUS:VAR|BlackJinniDustVortexDC|10+(HD/2)+CON		SOURCEPAGE:p.82
Obscuring Cloud			KEY:Obscuring Cloud ~ Black Jinni			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Defensive								DESC:A black jinni is continually surrounded by a cloud of obscuring dust and scouring wind. This cloud gives it a +8 racial bonus to its Hide check while within a sandstorm or other area of blowing dust.

Any strong (or stronger) wind can suppress the obscuring cloud as long as the wind persists.

Immersion in any liquid ends this ongoing damage, as does contact with a metal object of at least Medium or larger size that is in contact with the ground.|BlackJinniDustShockingTouchDC																																																													BONUS:VAR|BlackJinniDustShockingTouchDC|10+(HD/2)+CON	SOURCEPAGE:p.83

Vulnerability to Recitation	KEY:Vulnerability to Recitation ~ Black Jinni	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Weakness								DESC:As cursed genies of evil and chaos, black jinn are strangely susceptible to certain recitations of holy tracts belonging to good or lawful deities or philosophies. These include the spells Dictum and Holy Word, but also forceful recitations of nonmagical holy sermonizing. If a cleric or paladin of a lawful or good deity makes a successful opposed Knowledge (religion) check against a black jinni as a standard action, the black jinni must make a DC 20 Fortitude save or be instantly destroyed, leaving behind only a small spot of charred ash.
