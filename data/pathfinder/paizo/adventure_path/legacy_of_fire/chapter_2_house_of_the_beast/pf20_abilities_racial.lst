###Block: Edimmu abilities
# Ability Name		Unique Key					Category of Ability		Type							Define							Description																																																																													Source Page
Dismissal Weakness	KEY:Dismissal Weakness ~ Edimmu	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.Weakness									DESC:If dismissal is cast upon an edimmu, it is immediately destroyed without its life implosion ability taking effect.																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.82
Frigid Touch		KEY:Frigid Touch ~ Edimmu		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural										DESC:An edimmu’s frigid touch deals 1d6 points of cold damage.																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.82
Life Implosion		KEY:Life Implosion ~ Edimmu		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural		DEFINE:EdimmuLifeImplosionDC|10+(TL/2)+CHA	DESC:Once an edimmu reaches 0 hit points it collapses upon itself, imploding with a final shriek that rips the life force from nearby creatures. Any living being within 20 feet of the edimmu at the time of its destruction must succeed a DC %1 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of Constitution damage.|EdimmuLifeImplosionDC																									SOURCEPAGE:p.82
Moan				KEY:Moan ~ Edimmu				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural		DEFINE:EdimmuMoanDC|10+(TL/2)+CHA			DESC:An edimmu's sorrowful moans force every living creature within 30 feet to make a DC %1 Will save to avoid becoming shaken. This is a sonic mind-affecting fear effect. Whether or not the save is successful, an affected creature is immune to the same ediummu’s moan for 24 hours.|EdimmuMoanDC																													SOURCEPAGE:p.82
Rejuvenation		KEY:Rejuvenation ~ Edimmu		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural										DESC:Upon an edimmu's destruction, the magics that bind it to the mortal world linger on. Thus, 1d4+1 days after an edimmu's destruction, the creature reforms with full hit points. The only way to destroy an edimmu is with an Atonement spell. The Atonement absolves the creature of its sins and sorrows, allowing it to finally return to its native plane.																			SOURCEPAGE:p.82
Storm Mastery		KEY:Storm Mastery ~ Edimmu		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural										DESC:Once per day, an edimmu can spend a full-round action to control the winds within 50 feet of it. It may change the speed and strength of the wind within this area, raising wind force to as strong as severe. It may control such winds for up to 1 minute, but can perform no other action while doing so. At the end of this minute, or when the edimmu takes another action, the force of the winds reduces by one level of strength per round until returning to normal.	SOURCEPAGE:p.82
