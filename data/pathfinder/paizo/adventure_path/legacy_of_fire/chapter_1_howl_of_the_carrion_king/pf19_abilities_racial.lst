Unluck		KEY:Unluck ~ Pugwampi	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural.Aura	DESC:A pugwampi radiates an aura of unluck to a radius of 20 feet. A creature in this area must roll 2d20 whenever a situation calls for a d20 roll (such as an attack roll, a skill check, or a saving throw) and must use the lowest of the two results generated. This is a mind-affecting effect that does not work on animals, other gremlins, and gnolls. Any character that gains any sort of luck bonus (such as that granted by a luckstone or divine favor) is immune to the pugwampi unluck aura.	SOURCEPAGE:p.83
