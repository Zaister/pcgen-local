# Ability Name	Unique Key				Category of Ability		Type								Define					Description																		Modify VAR						Source Page		Aspects								Description of the Benefits
Firebleed		KEY:Firebleed ~ Xotani		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary			DEFINE:XotaniFirebleedDC|0		DESC:As a creature of living fire and wrath, Xotani ferociously strikes back against any creature that wounds it.	BONUS:VAR|XotaniFirebleedDC|10+HD/2+CON	SOURCEPAGE:p.88										BENEFIT:As a creature of living fire and wrath, Xotani ferociously strikes back against any creature that wounds it. Any attack that does more than 10 points of damage to Xotani causes the wound to erupt in a 30-foot cone of magma. This cone deals 1d6 points of fire damage plus an additional 1d6 points of fire damage for every 10 points of damage dealt by the attack. Thus, an attack dealing 22 points of damage results in a cone dealing 3d6 points of fire damage, while an attack dealing 49 points of damage results in a cone dealing 5d6 points of fire damage. Creatures affected by the cone may make a DC %1 Reflex save to take only half damage. Ranged attacks and any magical attacks that deal damage also cause this special ability to take effect. Xotani cannot firebleed at will, but might do so 10 times per round (an amount equal to its Constitution modifier).|XotaniFirebleedDC
Heat			KEY:Heat ~ Xotani			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary			DEFINE:XotaniHeatDC|10+(HD/2)+CON	DESC:Xotani generates heat so intense that anything touching its body takes 4d8 points of fire damage.									SOURCEPAGE:p.89	ASPECT:Ability Benefit|(Fort DC %2)|XotaniHeatDC	BENEFIT:Xotani generates heat so intense that anything touching its body takes 4d8 points of fire damage. Creatures striking Xotani with natural attacks or unarmed strikes are subject to this damage, but creatures striking with melee weapons are not. The heat can melt or burn weapons; any weapon that strikes Xotani is allowed a DC %1 Fortitude save to avoid taking damage.|XotaniHeatDC
Regeneration	KEY:Regeneration ~ Xotani	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.ModifyHP							DESC:No form of attack can suppress Xotani's regeneration--it regenerates even if disintegrated 89													ASPECT:Ability Benefit|40					BENEFIT:No form of attack can suppress Xotani's regeneration--it regenerates even if disintegrated or slain by a death effect. If Xotani fails a save against an effect that would kill it instantly, it rises from death 3 rounds later with 1 hit point if no further damage is inflicted upon its remains. It can be banished or otherwise transported as a means to save a region, but the method to truly kill it has yet to be discovered.
