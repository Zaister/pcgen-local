The mark of wrath provides you with a +1 insight bonus to AC and on attack and damage rolls. Once per day as a swift action, you can call upon the mark to protect you with a Fire Shield (CL 15th). If you are slain in combat, the mark of wrath transfers to the brow of your defeater. It can be removed with a successful Break Enchantment against CL 20th. Once removed in this manner, it vanishes forever.	BONUS:COMBAT|AC|1|TYPE=Insight	BONUS:COMBAT|TOHIT|1|TYPE=Insight	BONUS:COMBAT|DAMAGE.Melee,DAMAGE.Ranged|1|TYPE=Insight	SOURCEPAGE:p.54
