Lamashtu's Mark	TYPE:General	PREDEITY:1,Lamashtu	PRESTAT:1,CON=13	DEFINE:LamashtusMarkDC|10+TL+CHA	DESC:You have been marked as one of Lamashtu's favored minions.	BONUS:SKILL|Intimidate|2|PREAPPLY:PC	BONUS:SKILL|Diplomacy|-2|PREAPPLY:PC	SOURCEPAGE:p.56	BENEFIT:Your abdomen bears several ugly scars, as if your belly had been torn open by a clawed hand. Lamashtu’s Mark identifies you as favored of the Mother of Monsters, and if it is visible, you gain a +2 bonus on Intimidate checks but a -2 penalty on Diplomacy checks. Once per day as a free action, you may invoke Lamashtu’s name as you strike a non-evil foe with any melee attack. As you do, you cause the creature struck to become deformed in some hideous manner (cloven hoof, horns, forked tongues, and vestigal limbs like wings and tails are common deformities). The deformity imparts a penalty of 1d4 points to the target’s Charisma score for 1 hour; the target can resist this effect by making a Fortitude save (DC %1). The physical deformity vanishes as soon as the Charisma penalty fades. Any offspring you sire or give birth to gain the fiendish template.|LamashtusMarkDC
