# Ability Name	Unique Key					Category of Ability		Type						Description																																					Source Page
Pallid Bond		KEY:Pallid Bond ~ Carrionstorm	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC: A carrionstorm never initiates an attack on a creature that openly wears an unholy symbol of Urgathoa or is itself undead. If attacked first by such a creature, the carrionstorm's swarm attack only deals half damage.	SOURCEPAGE:p.83

Baleful Shriek	KEY:Baleful Shriek ~ Revenant	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural		DEFINE:RevenantBalefulShirekDC|10+(HD/2)+CHA	DESC:Once every 1d4 rounds, a revenant can use its baleful shriek as a standard action. All creatures within 60 feet of the revenant must make a DC %1 Will save or cower in fear for 1d4 rounds. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.|RevenantBalefulShirekDC																																																																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.90
Reason to Hate	KEY:Reason to Hate ~ Revenant	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural										DESC:A revenant's undead existence is fueled by its undying hatred for the creature that murdered it. As long as this creature exists, the revenant exists. If this creature is killed, the revenant immediately drops to the ground and is destroyed as well. Note that a living murderer who becomes an undead creature does not trigger a revenant's death. If a murderer is brought back to life after dying (or later becomes an undead creature), the revenant returns to life as well unless its body has been destroyed completely. A revenant's driving goal is to confront its murderer and slay him. When a revenant encounters its murderer, it immediately attacks, gaining the benefits of a haste spell (CL 20th) that lasts as long as its murderer remains in sight. Against its murderer, the revenant gains a +4 profane bonus on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, grapple checks, and saving throws.																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.83
Self-Loathing	KEY:Self-Loathing ~ Revenant	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary										DESC:A revenant is filled with an overwhelming sense of self-loathing - the only thing that approaches its hatred of its killer is its hatred of what it has itself become. When confronted with a mirror or any object that was important to it in life (such as a recognizable and cherished possession or an old friend or family member), the revenant must make a DC 20 Will save to avoid becoming overwhelmed with remorse and self-pity. This condition renders the revenant helpless, and continues until the revenant is attacked or until it sees its murderer (or any iconic possession it recognizes as once belonging to its murderer), whereupon the monster emerges from its self-loathing to attack the source of whatever roused it from its helpless state. If a revenant makes its saving throw to avoid becoming overwhelmed with self-loathing, it becomes obsessed with the creature or object that triggered the saving throw and does everything it can to destroy it, treating the object as if it were its murderer and gaining the appropriate bonuses while the creature or object remains in sight (see Reason to Hate).	SOURCEPAGE:p.83
Sense Murderer	KEY:Sense Murderer ~ Revenant	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.Sense									DESC:A revenant can use Locate Creature at will (CL 20th), but only against the being that murdered it. If the murderer is outside of the revenant's range, it seeks out the closest location it recalls from life that it associates with its murderer and haunts the region until it is destroyed or its murderer dies. Against its murderer, a revenant has True Seeing and Discern Lies in effect at all times (CL 20th); these abilities cannot be dispelled.
