###Block: Crag Spider abilities
# Ability Name	Unique Key				Category of Ability		Type						Description																																																																																																																			Source Page
Tether		KEY:Tether ~ Crag Spider	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:As a move action, a crag spider can anchor itself to a surface within its reach by a tether of webbing. This web is identical in characteristics to its normal webbing. A tethered crag spider gains a +10 competence bonus on Climb and Acrobatics checks made to jump and can arrest any fall as a free action, taking no damage. The maximum distance a crag spider can jump or climb while tethered is 200 feet. It can release its tether as a free action and start another normally if it needs to move its anchor point. A crag spider cannot use any of its other web abilities while anchored to a tether. Creating a tether counts as one of the eight times a crag spider can throw its web per day.	SOURCEPAGE:p.77
