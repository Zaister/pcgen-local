###Block: Nosferatu Abilities
# Ability Name		Unique Key				Category of Ability		Type									Description																																																																																																					Source Page		Description of the Benefits
Blood Drain			KEY:Blood Drain ~ Nosferatu	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural				DESC:A nosferatu can suck blood from a grappled opponent; if the nosferatu establishes or maintains a pin, it drains blood, dealing 1d4 points of Constitution damage.																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.88	BENEFIT:A nosferatu can suck blood from a grappled opponent; if the nosferatu establishes or maintains a pin, it drains blood, dealing 1d4 points of Constitution damage. The nosferatu heals 5 hit points or gains 5 temporary hit points for 1 hour (up to a maximum number of temporary hit points equal to its full normal hit points) each round it drains blood.
Dominate			KEY:Dominate ~ Nosferatu	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural				DESC:A nosferatu can crush a humanoid opponent's will as a standard action.																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.88	BENEFIT:A nosferatu can crush a humanoid opponent's will as a standard action. Anyone the nosferatu targets must succeed on a Will save or fall instantly under the nosferatu's influence, as though by a dominate person spell (caster level 12th). The ability has a range of 30 feet. At the GM's discretion, some nosferatus might be able to affect different creature types with this power.
Spider Climb		KEY:Spider Climb ~ Nosferatu	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.ModifyMovement	DESC:A nosferatu can climb sheer surfaces as though under the effects of a spider climb spell.																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.89
Swarm Form			KEY:Swarm Form ~ Nosferatu	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural				DESC:As a standard action, a nosferatu can change into a bat swarm, centipede swarm, rat swarm, or spider swarm.																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.89	BENEFIT:As a standard action, a nosferatu can change into a bat swarm, centipede swarm, rat swarm, or spider swarm. The swarm has the same number of hit points as the nosferatu, and any damage done to the swarm affects the nosferatu. While in swarm form, a nosferatu cannot use its natural claw attack or any of its special attacks, although it gains the natural weapons and extraordinary special attacks of the swarm it transformed in. It also retains all of its usual special qualities. While in swarm form, the nosferatu is still considered to be an undead creature with its total number of Hit Dice. It can remain in swarm form until it assumes another form; retakes its original form as a standard action; or until the next sunrise.
Telekinesis			KEY:Telekinesis ~ Nosferatu	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural				DESC:As a standard action, a nosferatu can use telekinesis, as the spell (caster level 12).																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.88
Telepathy			KEY:Telepathy ~ Nosferatu	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural				DESC:A nosferatu can communicate telepathically with any creature within 60 feet that speaks the same languages. In addition, a nosferatu can communicate with any animal, magical beast, or vermin.																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.89
Nosferatu Weaknesses						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Weakness					DESC:Nosferatus cannot tolerate the strong odor of garlic, they recoil from mirrors or strongly presented holy symbols. Nosferatus cannot enter a private home or dwelling unless invited in by someone with the authority to do so. Reducing a nosferatu's hit points to 0 or lower incapacitates it but doesn't always destroy it. Exposing any nosferatu to direct sunlight destroys it utterly on the second consecutive round of exposure. Immersion in running water inflicts damage on a nosferatu equal to 1/3 of its maximum hit points. Driving a wooden stake through a helpless nosferatu's heart instantly slays it.	SOURCEPAGE:p.89	BENEFIT:Nosferatus cannot tolerate the strong odor of garlic and will not enter an area laced with it. Similarly, they recoil from mirrors or strongly presented holy symbols. These things don't harm the nosferatu--they merely keep it at bay. A recoiling nosferatu must stay at least 5 feet away from the mirror or holy symbol and cannot touch or make melee attacks against that creature. Holding a nosferatu at bay takes a standard action. After 1 round, a nosferatu can overcome its revulsion of the object and function normally each round it makes a DC 25 Will save. Nosferatus cannot enter a private home or dwelling unless invited in by someone with the authority to do so. Reducing a nosferatu's hit points to 0 or lower incapacitates it but doesn't always destroy it (see fast healing). However, certain attacks can slay nosferatus. Exposing any nosferatu to direct sunlight staggers it on the first round of exposure and destroys it utterly on the second consecutive round of exposure if it does not escape. Each round of immersion in running water inflicts damage on a nosferatu equal to onethird of its maximum hit points--a nosferatu reduced to 0 hit points in this manner is destroyed. Driving a wooden stake through a helpless nosferatu's heart instantly slays it (this is a full-round action). However, it returns to life if the stake is removed, unless the head is also severed and anointed with holy water.
