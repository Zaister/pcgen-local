Dream Web		KEY:Dream Web ~ Dream Spider	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	DEFINE:DreamWebDC|10+(HD/2)+CON	DESC:A dream spider's webs carry an iridescent hue, making them easy to notice with a DC 15 Perception check. Any animal, humanoid, giant, or monstrous humanoid that comes in contact with these webs experiences strange hallucinations, taking 1 point of Wisdom damage per round of contact. A DC %1 Fortitude save negates this damage. If the webs of a dream spider are burned, they create a spread of poisonous gas in a 10-foot radius. This gas deals 1d4 points of Wisdom damage to all creatures in the area, not just to those susceptible to contact with webs as listed above. A DC %1 Fortitude save halves this damage. The cloud of colorful vapor remains for only a single round before dissipating harmlessly.|DreamWebDC	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Web	BONUS:VAR|DreamWebDC|2|PREFEAT:1,Ability Focus (Dream Web)	SOURCEPAGE:p.82
