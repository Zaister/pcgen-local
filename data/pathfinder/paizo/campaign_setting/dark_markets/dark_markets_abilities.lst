###Block: Ghul Abilities
# Ability Name	Unique Key			Category of Ability		Type						Description																																																																													Source Page
Bleed			KEY:Bleed ~ Ghul		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	DESC:A ghul can cause wounds that continue to bleed, inflicting 1 additional point of damage each round at the start of the affected creature's turn. This bleeding can be stopped by a successful DC 15 Heal skill check or through the application of any magical healing.																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.62
Change Shape	KEY:Change Shape ~ Ghul	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:A ghul's natural form is that of a donkey-hoofed undead janni. It always has the same appearance and traits in this form. It can also assume the form of a hyena. A ghul remains in one form until it chooses to assume the other one. A change in form cannot be dispelled, nor does a ghul revert to its natural form when killed. A ghul does not detect as undead while in its hyena form. A true seeing spell, however, reveals its undead form if it is in hyena form.	SOURCEPAGE:p.62
Cursed Claws	KEY:Cursed Claws ~ Ghul	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	DESC:A ghul's wickedly curved claws are as hard as steel and count as both cold iron and magic for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction.

Change Shape	KEY:Change Shape ~ Great Ghul	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural									DESC:A great ghul's natural form is that of a donkey-hoofed undead genie.

Create Spawn	KEY:Create Spawn ~ Great Ghul	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural									DESC:Any humanoid slain by a great ghul becomes a ghoul on the next moonrise. Likewise, a slain janni becomes a ghul and a slain genie becomes a great ghul. Blessing or destroying the body (such as with acid or fire) prevents this reanimation.																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.63
Heat			KEY:Heat ~ Great Ghul		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary.GreatGhulAbility						DESC:As a free action, a great ghul can raise its body temperature to that of molten iron or lower it to that of cold, undead flesh. A great ghul's red-hot body deals 1d6 points of extra fire damage whenever it hits in melee, or in each round it maintains a hold when grappling. Only a great ghul that was once an efreeti can have this ability.																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.63
Metalmorph		KEY:Metalmorph ~ Great Ghul	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural.GreatGhulAbility	DEFINE:GhulMetalmorphDC|0	DESC:As a standard action, a great ghul may warp and deform any one metal object within 20 feet. This functions like warp wood, but affects only metal objects that fail a DC %1 Fortitude save (attended objects use their wielder's saves). Armor or shields lose half their bonus to AC (enhancement bonuses are unaffected), and weapons are rendered useless except as improvised clubs. The transformation lasts 1 minute, after which the affected metal reverts to its normal state. Only a great ghul that was once a shaitain can have this ability.|GhulMetalmorphDC																						BONUS:VAR|GhulMetalmorphDC|10+(HD/2)+CHA	SOURCEPAGE:p.63

The water deals 1d6 hit points of damage and blinds anyone it hits for 1d6 rounds. A successful Reflex save (DC %1) means a creature takes half damage and is not blinded. Only a great ghul that was once a marid can have this ability.|GhulWatersFuryDC																																																												BONUS:VAR|GhulWatersFuryDC|10+(HD/2)+CHA	SOURCEPAGE:p.63
Whirlwind		KEY:Whirlwind ~ Great Ghul	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural.GreatGhulAbility	DEFINE:GhulWhirlwindDC|0	DESC:As a standard action a great ghul can transform itself into a whirlwind of air, bone shards, and pieces of gristle, with its head floating about. A great ghul's movement while in whirlwind form does not provoke attacks of opportunity, even if the great ghul enters the space another creature occupies. Any creature sharing a space with the whirlwind or attacking it with natural weapons takes 1d6 hit points of damage. Any living creature that begins its turn in the whirlwind's space must succeed on a DC %1 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1 round. Returning to its normal form is a standard action. Only a great ghul that was once a djinni can have this ability.|GhulWhirlwindDC	BONUS:VAR|GhulWhirlwindDC|10+(HD/2)+CHA	SOURCEPAGE:p.63
