DESC:Welcome to the Bloodrager class from the Advanced Class Guide playtest! Due to be released in August 2014, the Advanced Class Guide will contain a wealth of new materials for players and GMs alike. Most importantly, the book contains 10 new classes, each one of which combines features from two existing classes to give you a brand new play experience. This playtest focuses on these 10 classes, including complete rules for the arcanist, the bloodrager, the brawler, the hunter, the investigator, the shaman, the skald, the slayer, the swashbuckler, and the warpriest.
