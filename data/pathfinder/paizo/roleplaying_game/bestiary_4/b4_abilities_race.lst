# Grendel abilities
# Ability Name		Unique Key						Category of Ability		Type								Define						Description																																																																																																																																																			Source Page		Aspects													Description of the Benefits
Brutal Surge		KEY:Brutal Surge ~ Grendel			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural										DESC:When Grendel expends mythic power to add a surge die to an attack roll, he also adds a surge die to that attack’s damage roll. This is not an action and does not require him to expend any additional uses of mythic power to use this ability.																																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.145
Gruesome Dismemberment	KEY:Gruesome Dismemberment ~ Grendel	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary										DESC:When Grendel successfully holds a creature he has grappled, he may expend one use of mythic power to attempt to dismember that creature. He attempts a grapple check; if successful, his target takes double his normal claw damage and the attack pulls off one of the target’s legs or arms. The target is sickened until it receives magical healing (or until it recovers to full hit points  by natural means), and takes 2d6 points of bleed damage each round. A creature with only one an arm cannot perform actions requiring two arms or two hands. A bipedal creature with one leg missing cannot walk or run; it can crawl or hop, but is denied its Dexterity bonus against all opponents. A quadrupedal creature with one leg missing is reduced to half normal speed. At the GM’sdiscretion, creatures with more than four legs affected by this attack may be able to move at normal speed.

Regeneration		KEY:Regeneration ~ Grendel			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.ModifyHP	DEFINE:RegenerationRate|10			DESC:You are difficult to kill.																																																																																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.298	ASPECT:Ability Benefit|%1 (unarmed strikes or natural weapons)|RegenerationRate	BENEFIT:You are difficult to kill. You heal damage at %1 points per round, as with fast healing, but you cannot die as long as your regeneration is still functioning (although you still fall unconscious when your hit points are below 0). Unarmed strikes or natural weapons cause your regeneration to stop functioning on the round following the attack. During this round, you cannot heal any damage and can die normally. Attack forms that don't deal hit point damage are not healed by regeneration. Regeneration also does not restore hit points lost from starvation, thirst, or suffocation. You can regrow lost portions of you body and can reattach severed limbs or body parts if they are brought together within 1 hour of severing. Severed parts that are not reattached wither and die normally.|RegenerationRate

# Myrmecoleon abilities
Death Throes		KEY:Death Throes ~ Myrmecoleon		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary			DEFINE:DeathThroesDC|10+(HD/2)+CON		DESC:When a myrmecoleon is slain, its body explodes, releasing the acids that churn within it. All creatures within a 20-foot-radius burst take 4d8 acid damage (Reflex DC %1 half).|DeathThroesDC																																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.198
Scalding Spray		KEY:Scalding Spray ~ Myrmecoleon		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary			DEFINE:ScaldingSprayDC|10+(HD/2)+CON	DESC:Once every 1d4 rounds, a myrmecoleon can eject a 60-foot cone of acidic chemicals from its mouth. Creatures caught in the blast take 8d6 points of acid damage and are blinded 8 for 10 minutes (Reflex DC %1 half damage and negates blindness). Following the initial  blast, the chemicals vaporize into a thick and noxious cloud 20 feet high with a 40-foot radius. Within the cloud, all sight is obscured beyond 5 feet. Furthermore, any living creature within the area of effect must succeed at a DC %1 Fortitude save or become nauseated for as long as it remains in the cloud and for 1d4+1 rounds after it leaves the cloud. Any creature that succeeds at its save but remains in the cloud must continue to save each round on the myrmecoleon’s turn. This is a poison effect.|ScaldingSprayDC																SOURCEPAGE:p.198
