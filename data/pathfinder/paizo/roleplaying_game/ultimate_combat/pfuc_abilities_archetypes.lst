While many fighters hone their weapon skills to a point of inescapable grace and lethality, there are those who live under the maxim that a good offense can be accomplished though an impenetrable defense. To these fighters, proper use of armor and shields ensures that they can fight another day, and that the frustration of enemies who can't seem to crack an armor master's superior defenses is just the first symptom of his foes' eventual defeat.

Deflective Shield	KEY:Deflective Shield ~ Armor Master	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 2nd level, an armor master specializes in using his shield to deflect attacks. He gains a +1 bonus to his touch AC, and this bonus increases for every four levels beyond 2nd (to a maximum of +6 at 20th level); however, this bonus cannot exceed the sum of the armor and enhancement bonus to AC provided by the shield that the armor master is currently carrying.

This damage reduction stacks with that provided by adamantine armor, but not with other forms of damage reduction. This damage reduction does not apply if the armor master is stunned, unconscious, or helpless. This ability replaces weapon training 1 and 3, and armor mastery.	SOURCEPAGE:p.44
Fortification	KEY:Fortification ~ Armor Master		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 9th level, an armor master can use his armor to shield critical areas from injury. He treats any armor he wears as if it had the light fortification special ability (Core Rulebook 463). At 13th level, his armor gains the moderate fortification special ability. This fortification does not stack in any way with armor that has these special abilities. In these cases the armor master takes the better of the two fortifications. This ability replaces weapon training 2 and 4.																SOURCEPAGE:p.44
Indestructible	KEY:Indestructible ~ Armor Master		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 20th level, an armor master gains complete immunity to critical hits and sneak attacks while he is wearing armor.

You cannot move across air in this way, nor can you walk up walls or other vertical surfaces. When moving in this way, you do not take damage from surfaces or hazards that react to being touched, such as lava or caltrops, nor do you need to make Acrobatics checks to avoid falling on slippery or rough surfaces.

In addition, whenever you deal sneak attack damage, you can sacrifice additional damage dice to apply a penalty to one ability score of the target equal to the number of dice sacrificed for 1 minute. This penalty does not stack with itself and cannot reduce an ability score below 1.																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.17
