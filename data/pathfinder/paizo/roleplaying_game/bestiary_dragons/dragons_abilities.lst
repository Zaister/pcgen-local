# Ability Name	Unique Key					Category of Ability		Type							Define							Description																																					Source Page		Aspects											Description of the Benefits
Blizzard		KEY:Blizzard ~ White Dragon		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural										DESC:An ancient white dragon can use its breath weapon to create a blizzard in the area around it as a standard action.																			SOURCEPAGE:p.100													BENEFIT:An ancient white dragon can use its breath weapon to create a blizzard in the area around it as a standard action.

It is similar to an acid fog spell but deals cold damage instead of acid damage. It also causes a rime of slippery ice to form on any surface the fog touches, creating the effect of a grease spell.

Ice Shape		KEY:Ice Shape ~ White Dragon		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural										DESC:A young white dragon can shape ice and snow at will.

Targets entombed by this ability can be freed by casting freedom or by physically freeing the creature from the ice (Hardness 0, 360 hit points).|TL
Icewalking		KEY:Icewalking ~ White Dragon		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary										DESC:This ability works like the spider climb spell, but the surfaces the dragon climbs must be icy.
