Dream Haunting	KEY:Dream Haunting ~ Wendigo		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural																														DESC:When a wendigo uses its nightmare spell-like ability, the victim is also exposed to wendigo psychosis.

Howl			KEY:Howl ~ Wendigo			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary			DEFINE:WendigoHowlDC|10+(TL/2)+CHA																						DESC:Three times per day as a standard action, a wendigo can emit a forlorn howl that can be heard up to a mile away. Any who hear the howl must make a DC %1 Will save to avoid becoming shaken for an hour. Creatures within 120 feet become panicked for 1d4+4 rounds, and those within 30 feet cower with fear for 1d4 rounds. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.|WendigoHowlDC																																																													BONUS:VAR|WendigoHowlDC|2|PREFEAT:1,Ability Focus (Howl)	SOURCEPAGE:p.281
Wendigo Psychosis	KEY:Wendigo Psychosis ~ Wendigo	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural			DEFINE:WendigoPsychosisDC|10+(TL/2)+CHA																					DESC:Curse - Nightmare or wind walk; save Will DC %1; onset 1 minute; frequency 1/day; effect 1d4 Wis drain (minimum Wis 1); cure 3 consecutive saves. When a victim's Wisdom reaches 1, he seeks an individual of his race to kill and devour. After completing this act, the afflicted individual takes off at a run, and in 1d4 rounds sprints up into the sky at such a speed that his feet burn away into jagged stumps. The transformation into a wendigo takes 2d6 minutes as the victim wind walks across the sky. Once the transformation is complete, the victim is effectively dead, replaced by a new wendigo. True resurrection, Miracle, or Wish can restore such a victim to life, yet doing so does not harm the new wendigo.|WendigoPsychosisDC											SOURCEPAGE:p.281
Wind Walk		KEY:Wind Walk ~ Wendigo			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.SpellLike				DEFINE:WendigoWindWalkDC|16+CHA										SPELLS:Innate|TIMES=ATWILL|CASTERLEVEL=18|Wind Walk,WendigoWindWalkDC	DESC:If a wendigo pins a grappled foe, it can attempt to Wind Walk with the target by using its spell-like ability - it automatically succeeds on all concentration checks made to use Wind Walk. If the victim fails to resist the spell, the wendigo hurtles into the sky with him. Each round, a victim can make a new DC %1 Will save to turn solid again, but at this point he falls if he cannot fly. Eventually, the wendigo strands the victim in some rural area, usually miles from where it began. A creature that Wind Walks with a wendigo is exposed to wendigo psychosis.|WendigoWindWalkDC																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.281
