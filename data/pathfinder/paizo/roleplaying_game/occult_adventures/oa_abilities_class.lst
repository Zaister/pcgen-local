Elemental Focus			KEY:Kineticist ~ Elemental Focus			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:KineticistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural								DESC:At 1st level, you choose one primary element on which to focus. This element determines how ou access the raw power of the Ethereal Plane, and grants you access to specific wild talents and additional class skills. You can select aether (telekinesis), air (aerokinesis), earth (geokinesis), fire (pyrokinesis), or water (hydrokinesis). You gains your selected element's basic utility wild talent (basic telekinesis, basic aerokinesis, basic geokinesis, basic pyrokinesis, or basic hydrokinesis) as a bonus wild talent.

Burn					KEY:Kineticist ~ Burn					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:KineticistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary				DEFINE:BurnCurrent|0	DEFINE:BurnDamage|0	DEFINE:BurnMax|0	DEFINE:BurnMaxPerRound|0	DESC:At 1st level, you can overexert yourself to channel more power than normal, pushing past the limit of what is safe for your body by accepting burn. Some of your wild talents allow you to accept burn in exchange for a greater effect, while others require you to accept a certain amount of burn to use that talent at all. For each point of burn you accept, you take 1 point of nonlethal damage per character level (%1). This damage can't be healed by any means other than getting a full night's rest, which removes all burn and associated nonlethal damage. Nonlethal damage from burn can't be reduced or redirected, and a kineticist incapable of taking nonlethal damage can't accept burn. You can accept only %2 point of burn per round. You can't choose to accept burn if it would put your total number of points of burn higher than 3 + your Constitution modifier (%3) (though you can be forced to accept more burn from a source outside your control). If you have accepted burn, you never benefit from abilities that allow you to ignore or alter the effects you receive from nonlethal damage.|TL-HD|BurnMaxPerRound|BurnMax																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							BONUS:VAR|BurnMaxPerRound|1+max(0,floor(KineticistLVL-3)/3)	BONUS:VAR|BurnMax|3+CON	BONUS:VAR|BurnDamage|BurnCurrent*KineticistLVL																SOURCEPAGE:p.11
Kinetic Blast			KEY:Kineticist ~ Kinetic Blast			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:KineticistClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.SpellLike					DEFINE:KineticBlastLevel|0		DESC:At 1st level, you gain a kinetic blast wild talent of your choice. This kinetic blast must be a simple blast that matches your element. As a standard action, you can unleash a kinetic blast at a single target up to a range of 30 feet. You must have at least one hand free to aim the blast (or one prehensile appendage, if you don't have hands). All damage from a kinetic blast is treated as magic for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction. Kinetic blasts count as a type of weapon for the purpose of feats such as Weapon Focus. You are never considered to be wielding or gripping the kinetic blast (regardless of effects from form infusions), and you can't use Vital Strike feats with kinetic blasts. Even the weakest kinetic blast involves a sizable mass of elemental matter or energy, so kinetic blasts always deal full damage to swarms of any size (though only area blasts deal extra damage to swarms). A readied kinetic blast can be used to counterspell any spell of equal or lower level that shares its descriptor. A kinetic blast that deals energy damage of any type (including force) has the corresponding descriptor.

Gather Power			KEY:Kineticist ~ Gather Power				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:KineticistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural								DESC:If you have both hands free, you can gather energy or elemental matter as a move action. Gathering power creates an extremely loud, visible display in a 20-foot radius centered on you, as the energy or matter swirls around you. Gathering power in this way allows you to reduce the total burn cost of a blast wild talent you use in the same round by 1 point. You can instead gather power for 1 full round in order to reduce the total burn cost of a blast wild talent used on your next turn by 2 points (to a minimum of 0 points). If you do so, you can also gather power as a move action during your next turn to reduce the burn cost by a total of 3 points. If you take damage during or after gathering power and before using the kinetic blast that releases it, you must succeed at a concentration check (DC = 10 + damage taken + effective spell level of your kinetic blast) or lose the energy in a wild surge that forces you to accept a number of points of burn equal to the number of points by which your gathered power would have reduced the burn cost. This ability can never reduce the burn cost of a wild talent below 0 points.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.12
Infusion				KEY:Kineticist ~ Infusion				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:KineticistClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural								DESC:At 1st level, you gain an infusion wild talent from the list of options available based on your elemental focus. You gain additional infusions at 3rd, 5th, 9th, 11th, 13th, 17th, and 19th levels. By using infusions along with your kinetic blasts, you can alter your kinetic blasts to suit your needs. Infusions come in two types, each of which changes a kinetic blast differently: a substance infusion causes an additional effect, while a form infusion causes the kinetic blast to manifest in a different way. Each infusion can alter only certain kinds of kinetic blasts, which are listed in its Associated Blasts entry. Each time you use one of your kinetic blast wild talents, you can apply up to one associated form infusion and up to one associated substance infusion.  Some infusions change the action required to activate a kinetic blast or entirely transform the kinetic blast's normal effects. The burn cost listed in each infusion's Burn entry is added to the burn cost of the kinetic blast the infusion modifies. The DC for a save against an infusion is based on the associated kinetic blast's effective spell level, not the level of the infusion. The DCs for form infusions are calculated using your Dexterity modifier instead of your Constitution modifier. When you modify a kinetic blast with a form infusion and a substance infusion that both  require saving throws, each target first attempts a saving throw against the form infusion. If a target succeeds and a successful save negates the infusion's effects, the entire kinetic blast is negated; otherwise, the target then attempts a saving throw against the substance infusion. If you form and substance infusions both alter the kinetic blast's damage, apply the substance infusion's alteration first. At 5th, 11th, and 17th levels, you can replace one of your infusions with another infusion of the same effective spell level or lower. You can't replace an infusion that you used to qualify for another of your wild talents.

Elemental Overflow		KEY:Kineticist ~ Elemental Overflow			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:KineticistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 3rd level, your body surges with energy from your chosen element whenever you accept burn, causing you to glow with a nimbus of fire, weep water from your pores, or experience some other thematic effect. In addition, you receive a bonus on your attack rolls with kinetic blasts equal to the total number of points of burn you currently have, to a maximum bonus of +1 for every 3 kineticist levels you possess (+%1). You also receive a bonus on damage rolls with your kinetic blast equal to double the bonus on attack rolls. You can suppress the visual effects of elemental overflow by concentrating for 1 full round, but doing so suppresses all of this ability's other benefits, as well. The next time you use any wild talent, the visual effects and benefits return instantly.|ElementalOverflowMaxBonus	DESC:As your body becomes more and more suffused with your element, you begin to gain more powerful benefits. Starting at 6th level, whenever you have at least 3 points of burn, you gain a +2 size bonus to two physical ability scores of your choice. You also gain a chance to ignore the effects of a critical hit or sneak attack equal to 5%% x your current number of points of burn.|PREVARGTEQ:KineticistLVL,6	DESC:At 11th level, whenever you have at least 5 points of burn, these bonuses increase to a +4 size bonus to one physical ability score of your choice and a +2 size bonus to each of your other two physical ability scores.|PREVARGTEQ:KineticistLVL,11	DESC:At 16th level, whenever you have at least 7 points of burn, these bonuses increase to a +6 size bonus to one physical ability score of your choice, a +4 size bonus to a second physical ability score of your choice, and a +2 size bonus to the remaining physical ability score.|PREVARGTEQ:KineticistLVL,16	DEFINE:ElementalOverflowMaxBonus|0	BONUS:VAR|ElementalOverflowMaxBonus|floor(KineticistLVL/3)	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Elemental Overflow ~ DEX CON|PREVARGTEQ:KineticistLVL,6

This can't reduce the total cost of the infusions used below 0. You reduce the burn cost by 1 additional point at 8th, 11th, 14th, 17th, and 20th levels.

Metakinesis				KEY:Kineticist ~ Metakinesis				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:KineticistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 5th level, you gain the ability to alter your kinetic blasts as if with metamagic feats by accepting burn. By accepting 1 point of burn, you can empower you kinetic blast (as if using Empower Spell).	DESC:At 9th level, by accepting 2 points of burn, you can maximize your kinetic blast as if using Maximize Spell.|PREVARGTEQ:KineticistLVL,9	DESC:At 13th level, by accepting 3 points of burn, you can quicken your kinetic blast as if using Quicken Spell.|PREVARGTEQ:KineticistLVL,13	DESC:At 17th level, by accepting 4 points of burn, you can use your kinetic blast twice with the same standard action, or swift action if you also use metakinesis to quicken the blast. When you use a double kinetic blast, all modifications, such as metakinesis and infusions, apply to both of the blasts, but you need to pay the burn cost only once.|PREVARGTEQ:KineticistLVL,17	SOURCEPAGE:p.13
Internal Buffer			KEY:Kineticist ~ Internal Buffer			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:KineticistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 6th level, your study of your body and the elemental forces that course through it allow you to form an internal buffer to store extra energy. The buffer starts empty and doesn’t replenish each day, but you can accept 1 point of burn to add 1 point to the buffer as a full-round action, to a maximum of 1 point total. This maximum increases to 2 points at 11th level and to 3 points at 16th level. Once the kineticist adds points to her buffer, they remain indefinitely until she spends them. When she would otherwise accept burn, a kineticist can spend 1 point from her buffer to avoid accepting 1 point of burn. She cannot spend more than 1 point from her buffer in this way for a single wild talent. Points spent from the internal buffer don’t activate elemental overflow or add to its effects. Similarly, this buffer can be used to exceed the limit on the number of points of burn the kineticist can accept in a single turn. 	SOURCEPAGE:p.13

The object must weigh no more than 5 pounds per kineticist level you possess. If the attack hits, the target and the thrown object each take the blast's damage. Since the object is enfolded in strands of aether, even if you use this power on a magic weapon or other unusual object, the attack doesn't use any of the magic weapon's bonuses or effectsit simply deals your blast damage. Alternatively, you can loosen the strands of aether in order to deal damage to both the object and the target as though you had thrown the object yourself (instead of dealing your normal blast damage). You substitute your Constitution modifier for your Strength modifier if throwing the object would have added your Strength modifier on the damage roll, and you don't take the –4 penalty on the attack roll for throwing an object that wasn't designed to be thrown. In this case, the object's special effects apply (including effects from its materials), and if the object is a weapon, you must be proficient with it and able to wield it with one handotherwise, the item deals damage as a one-handed improvised weapon for a creature of your size.

Flesh of Stone	KEY:Wild Talent ~ Flesh of Stone	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:KineticistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.WildTalent.WildTalentDefense.Supernatural	DESC:Your skin hardens like stone, dampening the impact of most attacks. You gain DR 1/adamantine. This DR increases by 1 for every 2 kineticist levels you possess beyond 2nd (DR %1/adamantine). By accepting 1 point of burn, you can increase the DR by 1 until the next time your burn is removed, to a maximum DR equal to your kineticist level. Whenever you accept burn while using an earth wild talent, the energy surging through you causes your damage reduction to change from DR/adamantine to DR/-- for 1 round. You can dismiss and restore this effect as an immediate action.|FleshOfStoneDR	DEFINE:FleshOfStoneDR|0	BONUS:VAR|FleshOfStoneDR|MAX(0,floor((KineticistLVL-2)/2))+1	TEMPBONUS:PC|DR|adamantine|%CHOICE-FleshOfStoneDR		TEMPBONUS:PC|VAR|BurnCurrent|%Choice-FleshOfStoneDR	TEMPVALUE:MIN=FleshOfStoneDR+1|MAX=KineticistLVL|TITLE=Choose DR	SOURCEPAGE:p.17	DR:FleshOfStoneDR/adamantine
Force Ward		KEY:Wild Talent ~ Force Ward 		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:KineticistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.WildTalent.WildTalentDefense.Supernatural	DESC:You constantly surround yourself with a ward of force. You gain %1 temporary hit points. You always lose these temporary hit points first, even before other temporary hit points. If an attack deals less damage than you still have as temporary hit points from force ward, it still reduces those temporary hit points but otherwise counts as a miss for the purpose of abilities that trigger on a hit or a miss. These temporary hit points regenerate at a rate of 1 per minute. By accepting 1 point of burn as a standard action, you can increase the maximum  number of temporary hit points provided by your force ward by half your kineticist level until the next time your burn is removed. If you use this ability multiple times, the increases stack. For every 2 points of burn you accept in this way, your force ward's rate of regeneration increases by 1 hit point per minute. Whenever you accept burn while using an aether wild talent, you siphon some of the energy from the aether flowing through you and your force ward recovers a number of temporary hit points equal to your character level, up to its current maximum. You can dismiss or restore your force ward as an immediate action, but doing so doesn't change the number of temporary hit points available, and the temporary hit points don't recover while this ability is inactive.|KineticistLVL	SOURCEPAGE:p.17

Bowling Infusion	KEY:Wild Talent ~ Bowling Infusion	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:KineticistClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.SpellLike.WildTalent.WildTalentInfusion.WildTalentLevel2	DESC:You bowl your foes over with the sheer mass of your kinetic blast. Attempt a trip combat maneuver check against each target damaged by your infused blast, using your Constitution modifier instead of your Strength modifier to determine your Combat Maneuver Bonus.  (Level 2; Burn 2)	SOURCEPAGE:p.17	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Elemental Focus ~ Aether,Elemental Focus ~ Earth	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Kinetic Blast ~ Earth Blast,Kinetic Blast ~ Magma Blast,Kinetic Blast ~ Metal Blast,Kinetic Blast ~ Mud Blast,Kinetic Blast ~ Telekinetic Blast
Extended Range	KEY:Wild Talent ~ Extended Range	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:KineticistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.SpellLike.WildTalent.WildTalentInfusion.WildTalentLevel1	DESC:Your kinetic blast can strike any target within 120 feet. This is a form infusion. (Level 1; Burn 1)	SOURCEPAGE:p.19
Kinetic Blade	KEY:Wild Talent ~ Kinetic Blade	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:KineticistClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.SpellLike.WildTalent.WildTalentInfusion.WildTalentLevel1	DESC:You form a weapon using your kinetic abilities. You create a non-reach, light or one-handed weapon in your hand formed of pure energy or elemental matter. (If you're a telekineticist, you instead transfer the power of your kinetic blast to any object held in one hand.) The kinetic blade's shape is purely cosmetic and doesn't affect the damage dice, critical threat range, or critical multiplier of the kinetic blade, nor does it grant the kinetic blade any weapon special features. The object held by a telekineticist for this form infusion doesn't prevent her from using gather power. You can use this form infusion once as part of an attack action, a charge action, or a full-attack action in order to make melee attacks with your kinetic blade. Since it's part of another action (and isn't an action itself), using this wild talent doesn't provoke any additional attacks of opportunity. The kinetic blade deals your kinetic blast damage on each hit (applying any modifiers to your kinetic blast's damage as normal, but not your Strength modifier). The blade disappears at the end of your turn. The weapon deals the same damage type that your kinetic blast deals, and it interacts with Armor Class and spell resistance as normal for a blast of its type. Even if a telekineticist uses this power on a magic weapon or another unusual object, the attack doesn't use any of the magic weapon's bonuses or effects and simply deals the telekineticist's blast damage. The kinetic blade doesn't add the damage bonus from elemental overflow. (Level 1; Burn 1)	SOURCEPAGE:p.20

Basic Telekinesis			KEY:Wild Talent ~ Basic Telekinesis			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:KineticistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.WildTalent.WildTalentUtility.WildTalentLevel1.SpellLike	DESC:This ability is similar to Mage Hand, except you can move an object that weighs up to 5 pounts per 2 kineticist levels you possess (minimum 5 pounds) (%1 lbs.), and you can move magical objects. Additionally, you can create a container of entwined strands of aether in order to hold liquids or piles of small objects of the same weight. You can dip the container to pick up or drop a liquid as a move action. If you possess the extended range wild talent, you can increase the range of basic telekinesis to medium range and increase the rate of movement to 30 feet per round, and if you possess the extreme range wild talent, you can increase the range of basic telekinesis to long range and increase the rate of movement to 60 feet per round. You can also use your basic telekinesis to duplicate the effects of the Open/Close cantrip.|5*max(1,floor(KineticistLVL/2))			SOURCEPAGE:p.23
Basic Aerokinesis			KEY:Wild Talent ~ Basic Aerokinesis			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:KineticistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.WildTalent.WildTalentUtility.WildTalentLevel1.SpellLike	DESC:You can create a light breeze that blows against a creature or object from a direction of your choice that follows the target wherever it goes. The breeze grants the subject a +2 bonus on saves against very hot conditions, severe heat, breath weapons, and cloud vapors and gases (such as Cloudkill, Stinking Cloud, and inhaled poisons). This wild talent doesn't function without air or while underwater. You can have only one such breeze active at any one time. You can also use your aerokinesis to make it harder to detect you or others by scent. You designate a number of creatures or objects equal to your Constitution bonus (+%1). These creatures and objects always count as being downwind for the purpose of determining the distance at which they can be detected by scent. This effect lasts for 1 hour or until you use basic aerokinesis again, whichever comes first.|max(0,CON)	SOURCEPAGE:p.23
Basic Geokinesis			KEY:Wild Talent ~ Basic Geokinesis			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:KineticistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.WildTalent.WildTalentUtility.WildTalentLevel1.SpellLike	DESC:You can move up to 5 pounds per kineticist level (%1 lbs.) of rocks, loose earth, sand, clay, and other similar materials up to 15 feet as a move action.

Basic Hydrokinesis		KEY:Wild Talent ~ Basic Hydrokinesis		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:KineticistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.WildTalent.WildTalentUtility.WildTalentLevel1.SpellLike	DESC:You can create water as the cantrip Create Water, purify water as if using Purify Food and Drink, and dry wet creatures and objects as if using Prestidigitation. While you cannot lift water into the air using this ability, you can create mild currents in a body of water by concentrating. These currents are strong enough to run a water mill as if the mill were being turned manually by a creature with a Strength score equal to your Constitution score (%1). |CONSCORE																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.23
Kinetic Healer 			KEY:Wild Talent ~ Kinetic Healer 			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:KineticistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.WildTalent.WildTalentUtility.WildTalentLevel1.SpellLike	DESC:With a touch, you can heal a willing living creature of an amount  of damage equal to your kinetic blast's damage. Instead of paying the burn cost yourself, you can cause the recipient to take 1 point of burn. If you do so, the recipient takes 1 point of nonlethal damage per Hit Die he possesses, as usual for burn; this damage can't be healed by any means until the recipient takes a full night's rest.

Kinetic Cover			KEY:Wild Talent ~ Kinetic Cover			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:KineticistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.WildTalent.WildTalentUtility.WildTalentLevel1.SpellLike	DESC:You call up elemental matter to defend yourself and your allies from attacks. As a standard action, you can select one face of a square within 30 feet of you and move elemental matter to block that face, providing total cover from that direction. The face you select must be supported by the ground, and the kinetic cover cannot support more than 5 pounds of weight. Water, ice, and telekinetic force are translucent, but earth, metal, mud, and the like are opaque and block line of sight. A creature who strikes the cover can easily destroy it. Regardless of its composition, the cover has hardness 0, AC 5, and 2 hit points per kineticist level you possess [%1]. You can have a number of kinetic covers in existence equal to your Constitution modifier + 1/2 your kineticist level [%2].

Telekinetic Invisibility	KEY:Wild Talent ~ Telekinetic Invisibility	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:KineticistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.WildTalent.WildTalentUtility.WildTalentLevel1.SpellLike	DESC:You weave strands of aether, bending light and dampening sound; this works as invisibility except that the aetheric bending is easier to notice than normal invisibility, so your bonus on Stealth checks is halved (+10 while moving and +20 while perfectly still). However, the dampened sound allows you to avoid automatic detection via sound-based blindsense and blindsight, but you do not receive the bonus on Stealth checks from this wild talent against a creature with such abilities.
