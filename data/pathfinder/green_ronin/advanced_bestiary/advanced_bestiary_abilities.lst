SOURCEPAGE:p.60
Bound to the Faith	KEY:Bound to the Faith ~ Divine Guardian	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:A cleric or paladin of the deity that granted the divine guardian its power can channel energy as if they had the Command Undead or Rebuke Undead feat, and as though the the divine guardian were an undead creature with one-half the total Hit Dice (character level) it actually possesses.																																																																																																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.60
Sacred Site			KEY:Sacred Site ~ Divine Guardian		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:Each divine guardian is assigned to guard a specific site sacred to the deity that invested it with power. This area may be a structure, series of structures, or natural site with clearly defined borders. It can be as large as a city, but in most cases it is a single temple complex or a sacred grove. Gods do not waste their powers on places that their worshipers can protect, so most divine guardians keep watch over abandoned burial grounds or lost temples. The divine guardian is charged with protecting the site from harm and preventing incursions by those not of the faith. It must keep its vigil until worshipers return or until the god deems the site no longer worthy of protection. Should the divine guardian ever move out of the area defined as the holy site, it immediately loses the divine guardian template, and any spellcasting ability the deity might have granted based on its class levels. It cannot regain the template unless it atones for its failure (usually by completing some quest or via an atonement spell) and re-enters the site within 1 week. Otherwise, it loses the template permanently, taking 6d6 points of Constitution drain as the years of lost food, drink, and sleep return to it tenfold. A creature that lacks a Constitution score takes 2d6 points of damage per Hit Die from this process. Even if it survives, the creature can never expect to regain the template.	SOURCEPAGE:p.60

Contract-Bound	KEY:Contract-Bound ~ Devil-Bound	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:A devil-bound creature has signed a contract of service in return for the abilities granted by this template. The devil must reveal its nature when the contract is offered, and it cannot hide the details of the contract in any way. The exact conditions of the contract vary with the individual devil, but all require that when the devil has accomplished certain goals or when a certain amount of time has passed, the signer must perform a specific task or set of tasks for the devil that offered the contract. The signer might or might not be granted the powers of the devil-bound template while completing the devil's tasks. If the signer fails to complete the tasks as specified in the contract, its soul appears as a gem in the devil's possession (as though the signer were the target of a Soul Bind spell), regardless of distance or plane of origin. If the devil is dead and the signer dies before completing her tasks, her soul is destroyed, and she cannot be brought back to life by any means. No magic can free a creature from a devil's contract; only the intervention of a deity can break the binding.	SOURCEPAGE:p.55

The servant has no special awareness of the genie but can communicate with it telepathically. Because of this bond, the genie can use Plane Shift to move to any location on the elemental planes, the Astral Plane, or the Material Plane that its servitor occupies at will. Genies use this power to check their slaves' progress on the tasks set for them. A genie that is displeased with its genie-bound creature can use a standard action to deal 1d6 points of damage to it or 1d4 points of damage to any one of its ability scores. The genie can also heal a like amount of damage (regardless of its source or type) at will as a standard action.	SOURCEPAGE:p.134
