Divine Music	TYPE:General.VersatilePerformanceReplacement	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Bardic Performance	PRESTAT:1,CHA=13	PRESKILL:1,TYPE.Perform=5	DESC:You have learned to tap into the "music of the spheres" and access at least a little divine magic. You can choose one cleric/oracle spell of up to spell level %1 to use as a spell-like ability once per day as a standard action (you must expend 3 rounds of bardic performance to activate this spell-like ability).

Infuriate Foe	TYPE:General.VersatilePerformanceReplacement	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Bardic Performance ~ Suggestion	PRESKILL:1,Perform (Act)=6,Perform (Comedy)=6,Perform (Oratory)=6	PRESTAT:1,CHA=13	DESC:If you expend 3 rounds of your bardic performance as a move action, a target creature within 60 ft. must make a successful Will save (DC %1) or immediately attack another target creature you designate. The second creature must also be within 60 ft. of you and the original target creature must be aware of the second creature. After the original target attacks once, the effect ends (regardless of success). A creature that makes its save is immune to the effects of your Infuriate Foe feat for 24 hours The subject may have to pass through dangerous areas (moving through a region covered by enemy archers) to get at the creature, or it may even have to break through a barrier. A barrier that requires more than 5 rounds to get through is considered impassable for the purposes of this feat. The feat ends immediately if the subject physically cannot reach the creature--including a situation forcing the subject to pass through an area that would, without a doubt, kill it. For example, a subject that breathes only in water but must cross land to reach its target is unaffected by the feat. While under the effects of Protection from Evil or a similar spell, the subject can ignore the compulsion, but such a ward does not prevent establishing the effect, nor dispel it. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect.|10+(BardLVL/2)+CHA	SOURCEPAGE:p.18
