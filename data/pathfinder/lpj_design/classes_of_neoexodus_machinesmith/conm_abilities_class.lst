Greatworks			KEY:Machinesmith ~ Greatworks	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MachinesmithClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural					DEFINE:MachinesmithGreatworkLVL|0													DESC:In order to craft grandiose examples of their art, machinesmiths create permanent energy sources, called mobius cores. They use this to power their most cherished creations. Machinesmiths do not create a mobius core lightly, for it means the crafter entraps a piece of their magical essence outside their body. At 1st level, a machinesmith can choose to create a mobius core in order to power a greatwork. At 5th and every five levels thereafter, the machinesmith upgrades a greatwork they currently possess in order to represent his growing skill and power. Upgrades must be performed in order and the machinesmith must meet the level requirements for the upgrade. The capabilities granted by previous upgrades remain and stack with any improvements granted by the new upgrade. When installing a new upgrade, the machinesmith may reconfigure old design decisions, such as damage types, made at previous upgrades unless otherwise noted. Unless specifically stated, only the machinesmith that created the greatwork knows the intricacies of the operating the machine. Spell-like abilities granted by a greatwork use the operator's levels in machinesmith to determine their effects. A machinesmith tinkers with their greatworks constantly. They initially create greatworks during their spare time, even the minimal down time during adventuring. However, if a greatwork is destroyed the machinesmith must start over. Remaking a destroyed greatwork requires 8 hours of uninterrupted work, plus 8 hours for each upgrade. In all other respects, this resembles the process for crafting a magic item. If a greatwork is lost and cannot be destroyed by the machinesmith, such as by an enemy, the machinesmith can sever the connection between their mobius energy and the greatwork, rendering it inert, one day after it is lost.

Analyzer		KEY:Greatworks ~ Analyzer		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MachinesmithClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural.MachinesmithGreatwork	DESC:Machinesmiths that prize knowledge or their surroundings build an analyzer. An analyzer communicates audio and visual information to the machinesmith. Using an analyzer is a standard action. All analyzers are tiny, have AC 10 (when not being held); hardness 5, HP 10. It can be held or worn. If worn, it utilizes the magic item slot for either eyes (goggles), or wrist (bracer). The machinesmith can use some analyzer powers at will, while others expend charges. These charges return automatically if not used for 8 consecutive hours. An analyzer has 1‚ÅÑ2 the machinesmith's level (minimum 1) + Intelligence modifier charges per day.

Mechanus		KEY:Greatworks ~ Mechanus		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MachinesmithClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural.MachinesmithGreatwork	DESC:Many machinesmiths create automatons capable of performing a host of duties. Whether or not the servitor is created from intricate clockwork, or steam driven pistons, they share the same capabilities. Unless granted a Master Upgrade, all mechani are unintelligent constructs that follow the machinesmith's instructions unfailingly.

Mobius Weapon	KEY:Greatworks ~ Mobius Weapon	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MachinesmithClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural.MachinesmithGreatwork	DESC:Some Machinesmiths enter battle with powerful energy weapons capable of obliterating targets. These weapons can take the shape from complex rods, high powered energy crossbows, fire arms, swords or axes made entirely of energy, or even more exotic and strange devices. Regardless of the shape it takes all mobius weapons generally function the same. The machinesmith must be proficient with the weapon used as the base for their mobius weapon, as well as physically possess it, either through purchase, discovery as treasure, or through a feat, trait, or other ability. It takes one hour to fit the weapon with the mobius generator. If the mobius weapon is lost or destroyed, the machinesmith must provide a new weapon to create a new mobius weapon, in addition to the normal steps in building a greatwork. If the machinesmith wishes to create a new mobius weapon, and the original is still extant, he must either destroy the mobius generator upon the old weapon, or disassemble the old weapon. Disassembling a mobius weapon is a Craft (weaponsmithing) check with a DC equal to the machinesmith's level + Intelligence modifier + any enhancement bonuses that the weapon possesses. Success indicates that the mobius core has been removed and can be placed on a new weapon with only an hour's work. Otherwise the greatwork must be rebuilt from scratch, as normal.

These machinesmiths are known as combat engineers.
