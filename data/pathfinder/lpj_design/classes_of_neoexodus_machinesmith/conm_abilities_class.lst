Greatworks			KEY:Machinesmith ~ Greatworks			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MachinesmithClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural					DEFINE:MachinesmithGreatworkLVL|0													DESC:In order to craft grandiose examples of their art, machinesmiths create permanent energy sources, called mobius cores. They use this to power their most cherished creations. Machinesmiths do not create a mobius core lightly, for it means the crafter entraps a piece of their magical essence outside their body. At 1st level, a machinesmith can choose to create a mobius core in order to power a greatwork. At 5th and every five levels thereafter, the machinesmith upgrades a greatwork they currently possess in order to represent his growing skill and power. Upgrades must be performed in order and the machinesmith must meet the level requirements for the upgrade. The capabilities granted by previous upgrades remain and stack with any improvements granted by the new upgrade. When installing a new upgrade, the machinesmith may reconfigure old design decisions, such as damage types, made at previous upgrades unless otherwise noted. Unless specifically stated, only the machinesmith that created the greatwork knows the intricacies of the operating the machine. Spell-like abilities granted by a greatwork use the operator's levels in machinesmith to determine their effects. A machinesmith tinkers with their greatworks constantly. They initially create greatworks during their spare time, even the minimal down time during adventuring. However, if a greatwork is destroyed the machinesmith must start over. Remaking a destroyed greatwork requires 8 hours of uninterrupted work, plus 8 hours for each upgrade. In all other respects, this resembles the process for crafting a magic item. If a greatwork is lost and cannot be destroyed by the machinesmith, such as by an enemy, the machinesmith can sever the connection between their mobius energy and the greatwork, rendering it inert, one day after it is lost.

Analyzer		KEY:Greatworks ~ Analyzer		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MachinesmithClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural.MachinesmithGreatwork	DESC:Machinesmiths that prize knowledge or their surroundings build an analyzer. An analyzer communicates audio and visual information to the machinesmith. Using an analyzer is a standard action. All analyzers are tiny, have AC 10 (when not being held); hardness 5, HP 10. It can be held or worn. If worn, it utilizes the magic item slot for either eyes (goggles), or wrist (bracer). The machinesmith can use some analyzer powers at will, while others expend charges. These charges return automatically if not used for 8 consecutive hours. An analyzer has 1‚ÅÑ2 the machinesmith's level (minimum 1) + Intelligence modifier charges per day.

Mobius Weapon	KEY:Greatworks ~ Mobius Weapon	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MachinesmithClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural.MachinesmithGreatwork	DESC:Some Machinesmiths enter battle with powerful energy weapons capable of obliterating targets. These weapons can take the shape from complex rods, high powered energy crossbows, fire arms, swords or axes made entirely of energy, or even more exotic and strange devices. Regardless of the shape it takes all mobius weapons generally function the same. The machinesmith must be proficient with the weapon used as the base for their mobius weapon, as well as physically possess it, either through purchase, discovery as treasure, or through a feat, trait, or other ability. It takes one hour to fit the weapon with the mobius generator. If the mobius weapon is lost or destroyed, the machinesmith must provide a new weapon to create a new mobius weapon, in addition to the normal steps in building a greatwork. If the machinesmith wishes to create a new mobius weapon, and the original is still extant, he must either destroy the mobius generator upon the old weapon, or disassemble the old weapon. Disassembling a mobius weapon is a Craft (weaponsmithing) check with a DC equal to the machinesmith's level + Intelligence modifier + any enhancement bonuses that the weapon possesses. Success indicates that the mobius core has been removed and can be placed on a new weapon with only an hour's work. Otherwise the greatwork must be rebuilt from scratch, as normal.

###Block: Machinesmith Tricks
Crossbow Turret		KEY:Machinesmith Trick ~ Crossbow Turret		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MachinesmithClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary.MachinesmithTrick.Gadget			DESC:The machinesmith creates a device that can automatically load, aim, and fire, any crossbow it is fitted with. This device is Small sized and swivels on a tripod. It has AC 9 , Hardness 10, 15 hp, weighs 30 lbs, and has a magazine attachment capable of holding twenty bolts. It can be fitted to any light, heavy, or repeating crossbow with an hour‚Äôs work. It takes a full round action to deploy the gadget into a space adjacent to the machinesmith. This space must be flat solid ground with no obstructions. Once deployed it immediately begins firing at its designated target as often as possible, taking all relevant penalties for doing so, using the machinesmith‚Äôs base attack bonus + intelligence modifier and any magical bonuses present on the crossbow or its bolts. It loads and fires at the same speed as it normally takes to fire the crossbow normally and continues to fire until its magazine is empty or one minute passes. If the target is out of the turret‚Äôs line of sight it ceases firing until the target is within sight again. A machinesmith can command a crossbow turret to change targets as a move action. The crossbow turret can remain activated for one minute before it must be recharged. A crossbow turret is recharged by operating the hand crank as a standard action to reset the mechanisms. Crossbow turrents may be attacked or disarmed; they have hardness 5 and 5 hit points, or a Disable Device DC of 20, which triggers an attack of opportunity against the person attempting to disable it.

Eye for Danger		KEY:Machinesmith Trick ~ Eye for Danger		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MachinesmithClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.MachinesmithTrick.Technique		DESC:Being accustomed to the sudden and often explosive hazards of operating mechanical devices hones the machinesmith to keep an eye out for the sudden and often lethal hazards of adventuring. The machine smith gains a +2 luck bonus on Reflex saves and initiative rolls.	BONUS:SAVE|Reflex|2|TYPE=Luck	BONUS:COMBAT|INITIATIVE|2|TYPE=Luck	SOURCEPAGE:p.8
Overdrive			KEY:Machinesmith Trick ~ Overdrive			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MachinesmithClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.MachinesmithTrick.Augmentation	DESC:The machinesmith outfits the mobius core inside the mechanus to output more power on command, sending the machinesmith‚Äôs mechanus beyond operational limits. As a swift action the machinesmith commands the core augmentation to activate, granting the mechanus a +6 bonus on strength and a +10 ft bonus to movement speed. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the mechanus‚Äô hit dice. These rounds need not be consecutive. A machinesmith must be at least 3rd level before selecting this trick.

Self Healing Automaton	KEY:Machinesmith Trick ~ Self Healing Automaton	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MachinesmithClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.SpellLike.MachinesmithTrick.Augmentation		DESC:The machinesmith augments his mechanus to use his repair ability on command. The mechanus can use the repair ability utilizing all the same bonuses as if the machinesmith himself was using it. When using the repair ability on itself the mechanus may do so as a swift action. Each use of this ability by the mechanus subtracts from the machinesmith‚Äôs uses of that ability for the day. A machinesmith must be at least 7th level before selecting this trick.
