DESC:As nations roar into full-blown warfare and soldiers begin the march to battle, the machinesmiths answer the call to arms. They bring forth newfound terror to the battlefieldâ€”fantastic weaponry and new experiments in mass destruction: portable cannons, armor giving a man the strength of a bull, and constructs that can both kill and cook. Twisting old techniques into newfound uses, the machinesmith constantly innovates in an arms race that can mean life or death for her and her nation.
