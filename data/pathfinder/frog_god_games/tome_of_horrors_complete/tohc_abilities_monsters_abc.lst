Immunity to Magic	KEY:Immunity to Magic ~ Brass Man	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Immunity							DESC:An iron golem is immune to spells or spell-like abilities that allow spell resistance.																	SOURCEPAGE:p.82	ASPECT:Immunity|Magic																											BENEFIT:A brass man is immune to any spell or spell-like abilities that allow spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below. A magical attack that deals electricity damage slows a brass man (as the Slow spell) for 3 rounds, with no saving throw. A magical attack that deals fire damage breaks any slow effect on the brass man and heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the brass man to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. A brass man gets no saving throw against fire effects.
