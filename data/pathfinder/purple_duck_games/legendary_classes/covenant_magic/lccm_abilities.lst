Influence				KEY:Medium ~ Influence				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MediumClassFeatures.ClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural			DEFINE:InfluenceLVL|0																DESC:As soon as the medium begins to explore her powers, she draws the attention of distant spirits who see her destiny entwined with theirs, are intrigued by her talents, or find her otherwise interesting. They mark her with their power, whether she wishes it or not. Each influence is associated with a particular sort of extreme event, and though not all mediums with the same influence realize their powers in the same way, many share a common link to the same sort of event. As she grows in power, this relationship often changes to her exerting her own influence to impress, coerce, or charm spirits into granting her greater amounts of power.  The influence imparts the medium with automatic knowledge of a single language used by associated spirits. In addition, during her trance, she can also borrow the power of such spirits in the form of bonus spell-like abilities and covenants that she need not pay for nor make any formal agreement to gain. If a covenant gained this way calls for choices to be made when the covenant is formed, the medium makes the choice when she reaches the level that first grants it, and may change her choice any time she gains a medium level. The bonus language, covenants, and spell-like abilities are determined by the influence chosen. Once a medium's choice of influence has been made, it cannot be changed.	DESC:At 20th level, a medium's influence becomes fundamental, allowing her to become a permanent part of the spirit world. The effect of her fundamental influence depends on her influence.|PREVARGTEQ:InfluenceLVL,20																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Medium Influence|1																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.4
Spirit Boon				KEY:Medium ~ Spirit Boon			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MediumClassFeatures.ClassFeatures.SpecialQuality						DEFINE:SpiritBoonLVL|0																DESC:At certain times, a medium's spirit guide can learn to impart a new boon upon its mistress. A medium gains one spirit boon at 1st, 3rd, 7th, 11th, 15th, and 19th levels. Using a spirit boon requires a spoken invocation to the spirit guide unless the medium is currently in a trance. Anything that can spoil verbal spell components (including deafness or a Silence spell) has the same chance to spoil this invocation and stop the spirit boon from taking effect, although that use of the ability is not wasted and the medium can try to use it again later. Unless a boon's description notes otherwise, that boon can be used at will. Some spirit boons require the medium to send her spirit guide to bargain for information, a magical blessing, or other benefit for a specific period of time. While the guide is gone, the medium cannot draw upon its powers or knowledge and she cannot activate a new spirit boon. Some spirit boons augment the casting of a spell-like ability. A spell-like ability can only be modified by one spirit boon at a time. The spell-like ability also requires a spoken invocation from the medium, just like any other use of a spirit boon, unless the medium is currently in a trance. As normal, anything that can spoil verbal spell components (including deafness or a Silence spell) has the same chance to spoil this invocation and stops the spell-like ability from being altered, although the normal version of the spell-like ability still takes effect and that use of the spirit boon is not wasted.

Spirit Guide			KEY:Medium ~ Spirit Guide			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MediumClassFeatures.ClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.SpellLike				DEFINE:SpiritGuideLVL|0	DEFINE:SpiritGuideBonus|0											DESC:Every medium possesses a spirit guide, an insubstantial phantom that speaks to her mind, watches over her, lends her its strength and wisdom, and offers her its services in contacting spirits and using spell-like abilities. The guide automatically grants her a single Guidance spell effect whenever she enters a trance; the bonus can be used at any time during the trance.	DESC:The competence bonus granted by the spirit's Guidance increases to %1 when applied to a d20 roll involving one or more fey, outsiders, or undead that are not your allies (including rolling initiative in a combat against such creatures).|SpiritGuideBonus|PREVARGTEQ:SpiritGuideLVL,4																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						BONUS:VAR|SpiritGuideBonus|floor((SpiritGuideLVL+2)/3)																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.11
Trance				KEY:Medium ~ Trance				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MediumClassFeatures.ClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural			DEFINE:TranceLVL|0	DEFINE:TranceDuration|0	DEFINE:InTrance|0	DEFINE:TranceConBonus|0	DEFINE:TranceChaBonus|0	DESC:As a move action, you can enter a trance to align yourself with the powers of the spirit world. You can maintain your trance for %1 rounds per day. Temporary increases to Charisma, such as those gained from the trance and spells like Eagle's Splendor, do not increase the total number of rounds that you can maintain a trance per day. While in a trance, you gain guidance from your spirit guide and tap into the power of your spirit influence. You gain a +%2 insight bonus on Constitution and a +%3 insight bonus on Charisma. In addition, you gain temporary access to one or more covenants and spell-like abilities determined by your influence. These covenants come from no patron in particular, instead representing the collective recognition of many spirits, and so use your Hit Dice and Charisma modifier in place of the patron's. Each of these abilities can be used once per trance unless the ability can normally be used more often. Like other medium spell-like abilities, you can have only one of each spell active at any given time; if you use it again, any previous instance of that spell-like ability ends immediately.&nl;When in trance, you can vocalize or speak on behalf of the spirit patrons whose power you are currently channeling, but cannot control your voice, and thus cannot use spell trigger or command word items, nor can you cast spells with verbal components or language-dependent spell-like abilities aside from those derived from your influence (though you can still use other spell-like abilities), nor can you use skills or performance abilities that require your voice. You cannot enter a rage during a trance and cannot enter a trance during a rage; you are immune to rage effects as long as the trance lasts.&nl;You can end your trance as a free action, but only if your trance has lasted at least %4 rounds. Thereafter, you are fatigued for 2 rounds for every round you spent in trance. You cannot enter a new trance while fatigued or exhausted, but can otherwise enter a trance multiple times during the same encounter. If you fall unconscious during a trance, the trance persists for 1 round, ending at initiative count 10 of the next round if you have not since recovered consciousness. This extra round counts against her number of remaining rounds of trance.|TranceDuration|TranceConBonus|TranceChaBonus|floor(TranceLVL/2)																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											BONUS:VAR|TranceConBonus,TranceChaBonus|4	BONUS:VAR|TranceDuration|2+var("STAT.5.MOD.NOTEMP")+(2*TranceLVL)																													SOURCEPAGE:p.11	ASPECT:CheckCount|%1|TranceDuration	ASPECT:CheckType|Rounds per Day	TEMPBONUS:PC|STAT|CON|TranceConBonus|TYPE=Trance	TEMPBONUS:PC|STAT|CHA|TranceChaBonus|TYPE=Trance	TEMPBONUS:PC|VAR|InTrance|1
Detect Spirits			KEY:Medium ~ Detect Spirits			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MediumClassFeatures.ClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.SpellLike																							DESC:At 2nd level, the medium can detect the presence of fey, undead, and outsiders (even ethereal, incorporeal, and invisible creatures of those types) at will. This ability functions like detect undead, except that she detects all of these creature types and the medium only risks being overwhelmed by spirits of an alignment opposite her own in at least one respect (law is opposite chaos, good is opposite evil, and nothing is opposite a neutral component).&nl;If the medium studies a haunt with this ability long enough to learn the strength and location of its aura, she can make a Knowledge (religion) check (DC 10 + haunt's CR) to learn the haunt's effect. If she beats the DC of the check by 5 or more, she learns a cryptic clue about the haunt's origin, generally in the form of a powerful emotion linked to a physical feature of the area or a fleeting glimpse of the past. If she beats the DC of the check by 10 or more, she also learns its destruction condition.	DESC:&nl;Starting at 7th level, the medium's spirit guide alerts her to the presence of spirits that could be detected by this ability within 60 feet in any direction. She must activate this ability and concentrate to learn more, but learns the number of auras in the area and the strength of the strongest aura on the first round, and the strength and location of the auras on the second round. These advanced abilities function only while the spirit guide is present.|PREVARGTEQ:MediumLVL,7																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.11
Item Activation			KEY:Medium ~ Item Activation			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MediumClassFeatures.ClassFeatures.SpecialQuality						DEFINE:ItemActivationLVL|0															DESC:Although a medium cannot cast spells, at 2nd level, she can activate spell trigger items as if her spell-like abilities were spells.	DESC:&nl;At 14th level, a medium can spend a use of one of her highest-level spell-like abilities to charge a staff if any of her medium spells known are among the spells in the staff and her highest-level spell-like ability is at least as high a level as the highest-level spell in the staff.|PREVARGTEQ:ItemActivationLVL,14																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.12
Seance				KEY:Medium ~ Seance				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MediumClassFeatures.ClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.SpellLike				DEFINE:SeanceLVL|0	DEFINE:SeanceDC|0	DEFINE:SeanceMaxHD|0									DESC:At 3rd level, a medium learns to call and bind spirits of many types. Although she does not have to make deals with specific spirits to gain her powers, she often finds it useful to make deals enhancing her already considerable magical power. In addition, she can use called spirits to guard her interests, to tell her secrets unknown to mortals, or to run important errands for her. Once per day, the medium can allow herself to be possessed by a spirit after a 10-minute ritual. During the ritual, her spirit guide departs and is unavailable (see spirit boons for the consequences of an absent spirit guide) while it seeks a creature that matches a description given by the medium at the start of the ritual. This ability can retrieve the soul of a fey, outsider, or undead with up to %2 Hit Dice. Specific creatures can be called by giving their proper names, and a true name (as described in Ultimate Magic) can make it easier to trap many outsiders and fey. This ability is similar to a calling effect, except that the creature's soul appears inside the medium's body if it fails a Will saving throw against DC %1. If it is affected, the creature's body vanishes for the duration of the  and reappears when its soul departs the medium's body at the end of the 's duration. The medium's soul remains, but may lose control of her body temporarily. This ability is otherwise similar to magic jar with no need for a receptacle.&nl;Each round that the possessed medium wishes to take any action that is not purely mental, she must make a Will save against a DC of 10 + 1/2 possessing spirit's Hit Dice + possessing spirit's Charisma modifier; if she succeeds, she can act normally for 1 round and keep the spirit present (in which case she must struggle for control again on subsequent rounds) or concentrate on containing the spirit as a standard action, granting her a +4 bonus on her next saving throw to maintain control of her body. Although the medium cannot speak unless she regains control from the possessing spirit, she can communicate telepathically with the possessing spirit (and perhaps convince it to relinquish control without departing for a brief time). A possessing spirit that does not wish to stay in the medium's body can return to where it came from as a full-round action on the third (or later) consecutive round it remains in control of the medium's body. Likewise, a medium can eject a possessing spirit on the third (or later) consecutive round she remains in control of her body as a full-round action. If the medium's body dies while she is possessed this way, both she and the spirit die (though the spirit may eventually reform, reincarnate, or otherwise recover from death if it is normally able to do so).&nl;A spirit called with  that falls under the medium's influence is willing to bargain with her, as creatures called with lesser planar ally, but determine the payment required based on the spirit's Challenge Rating rather than its Hit Dice.&nl;Unless the spirit and medium have reached an agreement or are otherwise on good terms when the spirit departs, its departure inflicts Charisma damage on the medium equal to 1d4 + the spirit's Charisma modifier; the medium can resist with a Will save for half damage. Since the medium invited the spirit into her body, protection from evil and related effects do not prevent the spirit from possessing her, but they can give her a reprieve from its control for as long as the protection lasts if she succeeds on a new saving throw. The possession ends after 1 minute per medium level. A possessing spirit can be prevented from running off with her body by subjecting her body to the same methods used to restrain a creature called with a normal lesser planar binding spell, but neither a magic circle nor a dimensional anchor (nor similar effects) can keep the visiting soul from departing to its own body when the 's duration ends.|SeanceDC|SeanceMaxHD	DESC:&nl;At 8th level, a medium can instead call such a spirit as if using lesser planar binding (using the creature type and HD limitations for ). As a true calling effect, this version of the  cannot affect spirits currently located on the same plane as the medium. (Extraplanar outsiders, ghosts, nightshades, shadows, and lurkers in light are almost always located on planes other than the Material Plane, and other types of spirits are found on other planes often enough for a general call for a kind of spirit such as couatl, lich, or rusalka to successfully reach at least one off-plane example of that creature.)|PREVARGTEQ:SeanceLVL,8																							BONUS:VAR|SeanceDC|10+floor(SeanceLVL/2)+CHA	BONUS:VAR|SeanceMaxHD|SeanceLVL+2	BONUS:VAR|SeanceMaxHD|1|PREVARGTEQ:SeanceLVL,13	BONUS:VAR|SeanceMaxHD|1|PREVARGTEQ:SeanceLVL,15	BONUS:VAR|SeanceMaxHD|1|PREVARGTEQ:SeanceLVL,16	BONUS:VAR|SeanceMaxHD|1|PREVARGTEQ:SeanceLVL,17	SOURCEPAGE:p.12
Magic Circle against Spirits	KEY:Medium ~ Magic Circle against Spirits	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MediumClassFeatures.ClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.SpellLike				DEFINE:MagicCircleLVL|0																DESC:At 4th level, the medium can cast a spell similar to Magic Circle against Evil once per day. Unlike for most spell-like abilities, she must provide the verbal and material components for the spell, and so cannot cast it during a trance. This magic circle functions against outsiders, undead, and fey instead of against evil creatures.	DESC:This ability lasts for %1 hours.|MediumLVL|PREVARGTEQ:MagicCircleLVL,8|PREVARLT:MagicCircleLVL,12	DESC:This ability lasts for %1 days.|MediumLVL|PREVARGTEQ:MagicCircleLVL,12	DESC:If the medium creates a new magic circle against spirits while another of hers persists, the old one ends.

All fey, outsiders, and undead within a 30-foot burst from the medium must make a Will save (DC %1) or be calmed for %2 rounds. All active haunts (including those that have been triggered but have not yet acted) in the area with caster level less than or equal to %2 return to a dormant state. Affected haunts cannot be triggered again while the quelling lasts. This ability does not grant the medium control over affected spirits, but does prevent agitated spirits from raging and joyous spirits from reveling. Affected spirits cannot attack except to defend themselves, and any aggressive action or damage dealt to them breaks the effect for all affected spirits and haunts. Quelling spirits requires speaking calmly and clearly, and thus it cannot be done during a trance. This ability can be used %3 times per day.|QuellSpiritsDC|QuellSpiritsLVL|QuellSpiritsTimes																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					BONUS:VAR|QuellSpiritsDC|10+floor(QuellSpiritsLVL/2)+CHA	BONUS:VAR|QuellSpiritsTimes|3+var("STAT.5.MOD.NOTEMP")																											SOURCEPAGE:p.13	ASPECT:CheckCount|%1|QuellSpiritsTimes	ASPECT:CheckType|Uses per Day

These rounds do not need to be consecutive. At 11th level, you can ask a single question to your spirit guide and send it to get a one-to-three word answer from any dead creature you can name or unambiguously identify (such as with exact time and place of birth or death), even if not enough of its body remains for it to answer, provided you send your spirit guide from within 30 feet of the location where the named creature died.

(For example, at 7th level, you may convert 0- or 1st-level spell-like abilities into 2nd-level spell-like abilities; at 10th level, you may convert 0-, 1st-, or 2nd-level spell-like abilities into 3rd-level spell-like abilities; and so on.)
